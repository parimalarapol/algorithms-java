## TruncateString
Consider the following operation on a string containing digits from 1 to 9:

1)if the leftmost digit of the string is divisible by 3, remove it from the string;

2)otherwise, if the rightmost digit of the string is divisible by 3, remove it from the string;

3)otherwise, if the sum of two digits on the sides of the string is divisible by 3, remove both digits from the string;

4)This operation is applied sequentially until the string is empty or neither of the three given conditions is met.

For a given string find the result of applying the given algorithm to it.

**Example**

For s = "312248", the output should be
truncateString(s) = "2".

Here's how the answer is obtained:

3 is divisible by 3 and should be removed ("12248");
neither 1 nor 8 is divisible by 3, but their sum is, so both digits should be removed ("224");
neither 2 nor 4 is divisible by 3, but their sum is, so both digits should be removed ("2");
the resulting string "2" doesn't meet any condition, so it is the final answer.

Guaranteed constraints:
1 ≤ s.length ≤ 15.
